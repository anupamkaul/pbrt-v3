origin	https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/ (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/ (push)

also see : https://gist.github.com/niksumeiko/8972566
(so: git remote add new_origin https://github.com/anupamkaul/pbrt-v3.git, etc, see git.migrate)

to bring in more changes:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3.git

now I have 2 remotes: upstream and origin
now fetch from upstream, merge/resolve conflicts, push <branch> to origin
