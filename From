origin	https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/ (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3/ (push)

also see : https://gist.github.com/niksumeiko/8972566
(how I did it: git remote add new_origin https://github.com/anupamkaul/pbrt-v3.git, etc, see git.migrate)

to bring in more changes:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3.git
now I have 2 remotes: upstream and origin
now fetch from upstream, merge/resolve conflicts, push <branch> to origin

----

v3 scenes are in git://git.pbrt.org/pbrt-v3-scenes

I tried git LFS but was getting errors and finally over-went my account allocation:
